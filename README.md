# Smart-charging-system
This project creates a mobile charging system using a turbine in moving buses or trains. The turbine spins a dynamo, generating electricity, which is stored in a battery and regulated to provide a stable USB output. This eco-friendly solution enables sustainable mobile charging, reducing reliance on conventional power sources.
